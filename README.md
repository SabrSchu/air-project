# 🌱 AIR Plant Project

A fancy application that handles advanced information retrieval. This project is designed to process a dataset and expose functionality via a FastAPI backend and a wonderful frontend.

## Overview
Plant Finder is a full-stack plant recommender system that helps users discover suitable plants baded on their own preferences. 
They can filter plants, or find them based on structured questions or free-text descriptions.
Plant Finder combines modern frontend UI with an intelligent backend, and advanced information retrieval, based on BM25 and SBERT.
